Continuous Monitoring :::

	Why we need Continuous Monitoring ???
	
	Environments :::
	
	Non-Prod Environments								Prod Environments 
	
	
		- Dev 
		- Build 
		- Test 
			QA 
			UAT						=====>					Production Servers
			
			
	Stability 
	
	High Availability 
	
	Issues will lead to downtime 
	
	Continuous Monitoring :
		- It ensures business Continuity 
		
		E_Commerce 				- www.amazon.com 
		Online Reservation 		- air/railway tkt booking system
		E_Learning 8PM IST 
		
			Monitoring Team -->
			
		Continuous Monitoring :::
	
	
			Infra-Structure Monitoring
			
				--> Production Servers (1,2,3,4,5)
						Process --> CPU Utilization of these servers reaches 100% , we cannot start any new process 
									80% 
										Kill some outdated process 
										
						Memory	--> Memory Utilization --> 75% 
															Execute some script to scale up the volumes /
															Clean-up the unwanted files/folders	
						
						Network Traffic -->
						
							Pod replicasets --> 10 Replicas of pod 	--> 100 Users 
																		50000 Users
																		
								75% Limit 
								Automate the scale-up																	
					
						Production Monitoring/Support Team - 24/7
						
						DevOps ???'
						
						
						
						Jenkins_Master 		--> Create CICD Pipeline Projects and schedule to run on Build Servers(Slave_Nodes)
							Jenkins_Slave1 	--> Build, Artifacts 
												1000 Microservices - build Java web application CI Pipeline
													- download source code 
													- create Artifacts 
													- docker Application Image 
												Memory Utilization --> 100% 
												
											Jenkins Job - Clean-up the workspace - every day 8pm evening! / Once in 2 Days
											
							Jenkins_Slave2 80 % webhook - jenkins - cleanup/add more volume/Attach new node.
							
							Monitoring Tool 
	
				- Prometheus/Grafana/Dynatrace/Nagios
				
			Application Monitoring
			
				- AppDynamics/DataDog/Nagios 
				
				Application Responses :::
				
				
			Infra-Structure Monitoring :::
			
				Architecture of Monitoring Tool(Prometheus)
				Components of the Architecture
				Setup the Prometheus 
				
					Install Prometheus Tool / Service 
					Create the Monitoring Dashboards/Metrics
					
				Prometheus 	 - Is a Monitoring Tool
				
				Grafana		 - Is a Visualization Tool 
				
		
			Architecture of Prometheus :::
			
			Installation of Prometheus and Grafana
			
				1. Manual installation / Configuration 
				
				2. AWS Platform - VM --> Cloud Watch - Dashboards
				
				3. Hybrid Environments - Prometheus
				
				
				Kubernetes Cluster ::		# prometheus can be executed as a pod
										
					Kubernetes Master 
						Kubernetes_worknode1
						Kubernetes_worknode2
						Kubernetes_worknode3
						Kubernetes_worknode4
